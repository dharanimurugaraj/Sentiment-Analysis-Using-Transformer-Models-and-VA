# **Sentiment Analysis Using Transformer Models and VADER for Business Insights**

## **Description**
This project demonstrates the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in sentiment analysis by leveraging two distinct approaches: the RoBERTa Transformer model and the VADER sentiment analysis tool. The goal is to classify text data, such as customer reviews or social media posts, into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. This application serves as a practical tool for businesses aiming to gain insights into customer opinions and enhance decision-making processes.

## **Key Features**
- **RoBERTa Model Integration**  
  - Utilizes the `cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment` model, a pretrained Transformer model, to predict sentiment with high accuracy.  
  - Suitable for processing short-form text data such as tweets, reviews, and survey responses.

- **VADER Sentiment Analysis**  
  - A lexicon-based sentiment analysis tool optimized for social media and short-text data.  
  - Provides a complementary lightweight alternative to Transformer models for sentiment scoring.

- **Visualization**  
  - Visualizes sentiment scores using bar charts for an intuitive representation of results.

## **Practical Use Case**
This project showcases a scalable application for businesses to analyze customer reviews from platforms like Amazon or social media. It provides actionable insights, aiding in:
- **Product Improvement**: Understanding customer feedback to refine products.
- **Marketing Strategy Adjustments**: Identifying sentiments around marketing campaigns.
- **Customer Engagement**: Addressing customer concerns based on sentiment trends.

---

## **Technical Stack**
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:
  - `Hugging Face Transformers`: For using the pre-trained RoBERTa model.
  - `VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer`: For lightweight sentiment analysis.
  - `Matplotlib`: For visualization of sentiment analysis results.

---

## **Application**
This project is a practical demonstration of NLP techniques and their real-world applicability, particularly in domains such as:
- **E-commerce**: Understanding customer feedback on platforms like Amazon.
- **Social Media Monitoring**: Analyzing public sentiment on trends or campaigns.
- **Customer Support**: Identifying customer pain points through textual feedback.

---

## **Project Structure**
- **Data**: Includes sample datasets like Amazon reviews for model evaluation.
- **Code**: Implements RoBERTa and VADER sentiment analysis pipelines with tokenization, inference, and visualization.
- **Models**: RoBERTa model is integrated directly within the Kaggle environment for streamlined execution.

## **How to Use**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers kagglehub matplotlib
3. Download the dataset using kagglehub:
   ```bash
    Download latest version
    path = kagglehub.dataset_download("snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews")
    print("Path to dataset files:", path)
4. Loas the pre trained models:
   ```bash
     from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification
     tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest")
     model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest")
5. Use the model for sentiment analysis on the dataset.
